1) Stuck at opening the program if it doesn't exists it will show "It doesn't exists". Not jumps to the steps of opening webpage of the provided query.
2) It opens any song file from the provided directory. 
    Eg:
        Input: "Play hooke up song"
        Output: `Opens any song from the directory`
    Reason: It may be due to analysis bug in the tempLib.py file.
    
    * All the bugs are same for videos as well.
3) Cannot open UWP apps.
